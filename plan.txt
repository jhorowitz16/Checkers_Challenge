Phase One

    get the basics done - display the starting board!

    Checker class 
        color
        id
        is_active

    Board class
        represent the board as 8 by 8 array
        add Check objects
        to_string - simple printout

Phase Two
    UI for making moves
    search for all checkers that have the option to move
        print the positions of those checkers and where they can go
            ==> maintain a set of all checkers
                iterate thru that set
                check if +1 +1 is unoccupied

    a move is delete the old checker and make a new one in the new place

Phase Three
    jumps
    search for jumps like before
    same but remove the old checker
    remove it from the checker set globally

    print the board again
